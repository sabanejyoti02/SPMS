I have three entities in my project, student, mentor, parent and admin. 
by default admin should have all privledges. for parent only veiw his child progress 
for student to view and upoload his own data for mentor to view and verify student 
and his data. I have used node js express and firebase to  build this. right now 
i only store data about student mentor. I have created api routes and defined controller 
classes to access database and update but i havent implenmented any security. 
how do i secure both my database and api endpoints and how do i assign specific levels of security to each entitiy
